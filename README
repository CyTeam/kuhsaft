== Kuhsaft. A CMS as simple as it could be

Yiiihaaaaaa! Howdy, Let's milk the cow!

== The Who, What and Why?

Kuhsaft is made by some Rails developers at Screen Concept that got tired of
fiddling with unusable content management sytems. We are trying hard to make a
minimalistic and developer friendly CMS. Our goal is to provide a system for
ourselves and our customers that makes the of-the-shelf website project a
hasselfree thing. On one side easy to set up, integrate and customize (good for
devs) on the other hand it should be easily usable by anyone.

== Requirements

Kuhsaft requires

* A Rails 3 app to be integrated into
* ImageMagick
* An ActiveRecord compatible DB

== Installation

Add Kuhsaft to your Gemfile:

  gem 'kuhsaft'

And run

  bundle install

to get the gem
